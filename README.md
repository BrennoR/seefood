Food classification app based on the popular show, Silicon Valley. Google's Inception V3 CNN architecture was trained on the
Food101 dataset. Models were produced using Keras and converted into iOS compatible CoreML format. The app was then built using Swift
along with the CoreML model to provide classification on the various types of food present in the Food101 dataset. The final model
reached an accuracy of 80% on the test set and on-field results were also shown to be extremely positive.
